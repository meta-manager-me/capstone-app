"User": The single user role encompasses of someone who uses the platform to view NFT content and share their own.

**User Personas:**

Jack is a student at the USC Roski School of Art and Design. Jack is a graphics design major and loves creating digial art in his freetime.
He has heard of these "NFTs" but is not very knowledgable in the world of web 3.0. His motivation for using this application is to 
take advantage of hot topic of crypto and utilize his skills to showcase his artwork while knowing its value is backed by blockchain. 
One of Jack's pain points is trying to reach a large audience with his content.

she has no idea what they are or why they even exist. Marthas motivation for using the application is to view NFTs from people at her school
